    content: `# Getting Started with React Hooks

React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components. They allow you to use state and other React features without writing classes.

## What are Hooks?
Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.

## Basic Hooks
- useState: For managing state
- useEffect: For side effects
- useContext: For accessing context

## Example Usage
\`\`\`jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = \`You clicked \${count} times\`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
\`\`\`

Hooks make your code more reusable and easier to understand.`,

    content: `# Mastering CSS Grid Layout

CSS Grid is a powerful layout system designed for two-dimensional layouts.

## Grid Basics
- grid-template-columns: Define column sizes
- grid-template-rows: Define row sizes
- grid-gap: Space between grid items

## Example
\`\`\`css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-gap: 20px;
}
\`\`\`

Grid makes complex layouts simple and responsive.`,

    content: `# TypeScript Best Practices

TypeScript brings static typing to JavaScript, making your code more robust.

## Key Practices
- Use strict mode
- Define proper interfaces
- Use generics wisely
- Avoid any type

## Interface Example
\`\`\`typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

function createUser(user: User): User {
  return user;
}
\`\`\`

TypeScript helps catch errors at compile time.`,

    content: `# Building Scalable APIs with Node.js

Node.js is perfect for building fast, scalable APIs.

## Best Practices
- Use Express.js framework
- Implement proper error handling
- Use middleware effectively
- Add authentication

## Basic Server
\`\`\`javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ users: [] });
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(\`Server running on port \${PORT}\`);
});
