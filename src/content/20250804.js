Before I begin, I would like to preface by claiming that this is not a complete encapsulation of the upshots and objections pertaining to moral non-cognitivsm and emotivism, nor do I make clear-cut verdicts on the types of cognitivism and non-cognitivism. These are just some of my thoughts on the matter.

### Introduction

The non-cognitivist standpoint regarding moral principles is one that claims that moral statements are not truth-apt (meaning we can assign truthfulness or falsity to moral statements), and thus statements about right and wrong are inherently meaningless. This is because moral statements are not analytic, meaning that they are not true by definition or are axiomatically true, or are substantiated by empirical verification. In contrast, cognitivists believe that moral statements are truth-apt, meaning that statements with moral predicates have the same effect of expressing belief as statements with descriptive predicates.

Emotivism is a variety of non-cognitivism. Not only are moral statements not truth-apt, but they function primarily to express emotions. If I say "theft is wrong", I am simply voicing my emotional disapproval for theft as someone who says "theft is right" voices their emotional approval for it. The statement itself cannot demonstrate that theft is wrong. **Ethical statements do not outline truths, but are expressions of emotion.** 

Furthermore, I believe that most moral terms have the dual objective of endowing itself with its descriptive predicate and achieving the emotivist objective. For example, the statement "he is ruthless" predicates itself with the definition of being ruthless. In fact, I can't think of a counterexample where a moral predicate does not intrinsically contain a descriptive predicate. The emotivist predicate outlines an assumption containing a basket of moral values - some being non-negotiables and some being arguable, which are then used to conclude the moral statement. When I say "theft is wrong", I am in other words claiming that the purview of core moral judgments or universal values that I uphold lead, by a priori means, to this conclusion. 

Before we continue, let's distinguish between types of statements. Consider these three statements.

<div className="border-l-4 border-primary/70 pl-4">
<div className="text-md">

  A) Thieves are people who steal. 

  B) You are a thief.

  C) You acted immorally by virtue of you being a thief.  
</div>
</div>

  

A) is an analytic statement, meaning that it is declarative and is true by definition. B) is a synthetic statement, meaning that it is a truth-apt statement as its truthfulness is dependent on the state of the world and is not intrinsically defined. These assertions can be confirmed or refuted by empirical observations. C) is a moral-judgment statement, meaning that C) is synonymous with the statement "Boo to theft!"

Non-cognitivists believe that only the first two statements are truth-apt, while cognitivists believe that all three statements are truth-apt. 

### Cognitivsm and non-naturalism

Before we defend the emotivist argument and subsequently dismantle it, I'd like to spend some time exploring some  defences and upshots of the cognitivst standpoint. More specifically, I would like to explore the cognitivist non-naturalist standpoint, which claims that moral statements are truth-apt statements, and are descriptive and meaningful. However, these descriptions are distinct from natural properties and cannot be reduced to any natural properties. The former is the cognitivist standpoint, while the latter is the non-naturalist standpoint. Here I first discuss non-naturalism before cognitivism.

Let's first consider the following line of reasoning (a modus tollens). Here, properties like being pleasurable or being happy are natural properties, while properties like being good or being right are moral properties.  

<div className="border-l-4 border-primary/70 pl-4">
<div className="text-md">

  P1: By definition, $x$ being good is equivalent to $x$ being pleasant. Therefore, the question "is pleasure good?" is equal to the tautological statement "is pleasure pleasure?". In the same vein, the question "is pleasure good" is a closed question.

  P2: The question "is pleasure good?" or the statement "pleasure is good" is something substantive and not meaningless; it is debatable.

  C: There is no analytic link between $x$ being good and $x$ being pleasant. Once it is estsablished that $x$ is pleasant, the question of whether $x$ is good is an open question.
</div>
</div>

By this chain of reasoning, the claim that $x$ is good is inherently a meaningless claim. Any connection between a natural property and a moral property leads to a tautology. 

This line of reasoning, known as Moore's *open-question argument*, can be applied to other value judgments such as propriety and duty. For example, consider Bentham's utility calculus where one must choose the action that maximises pleasure and minimises pain. The question "$x$ adheres to Bentham's utility calculus, but is $x$ right?" is an open question. Mill's utilitarianism, connecting the state of happiness (which exists naturally) and the state of being good (a moral property), commits what Moore calls the *naturalistic fallacy.*

I'll consider some objections to the non-naturalist perspective. 

The first objection is rather simple. Can a natural property P be identical to good? The non-naturalist standpoint claims that because this is an open question, no natural property P can be identical to good. This argument begs the question against the naturalism perspective (by directly assuming that the naturalistic position is fallacious) as it assumes that "pleasure is good" is not tautological. 

But let's assume that we procured a non-tautological statement like "pleasure is good". "Good" may fall into the category of dubious moral statements which content is not explicitly elucidated, but is equivalent to a natural concept wherein said equivalence is not obvious and is not well-elucidated to us. Perhaps a better way to put this is that "good" may not be non-natural; it is just that we have yet to found the basis to demonstrate its naturality. 

There is much discourse on this topic specifically revolving around the "paradox of analysis", which we won't delve much into here. The core upshot is that it is possible for two different expressions to refer to the same thing, even if the definition seems to be an open question. Here it is implied that an adequate anlaysis is a transparent one, when in reality the analysans may not be equivalent in meaning to the analysandum. Therefore, if said property P was a property of good, the ambiguity of the identity relation may mean that we still consider the question of whether P is identical to good an open one. 

There are some issues with these objections which I will briefly go through. Although the open-question argument seems to be a question-begging argument, the begged questions are not conceptually open "to competent users of moral terms". For a competent analyst, the question "is pleasure good" is evidently more open than the question "is NaCl table salt?" A common way of laying out this argument is by appealing to the fact that opponents of non-naturalism can see that some questions are conceptually open; thus non-naturalism is not a direct consequence of the argument's premise. However this is a much weaker version of the original open-question argument.

In fact one can see that most of the counterarguments to these objections, after a dialectical process, can be resolved by suggesting this weaker version of the open-question argument. This, commonly known as the *argument to the best explanation*, claims that the best explanation for the premise that identity questions seem open to competent analysts of moral terms is that they are open. This is perhaps not a superlatively satisfying conclusion but seems tenable once we consider the motivational internalist premise - that there is a conceptual connection between moral judgments and motivations to act (typically fuelled by some desire fulfilled by said act). If we accept the internalist theory of motivation, then we accept that moral propositions and motivations to act are not analytically equivalent. Thus it is unclear whether natural properties fuel our motivations to act. This Humean tenet is also, I hold, a tenable non-cognitivist strategy.

One counter-argument that naturalists use is that although Moore's questions may seem open, moral properties may be equivalent to naturalistic properties in a non-tautological sense through empirical discovery. But the world is often not black-and-white, and even though we cannot conclude that two terms P and Q may not be distinct, we cannot immediately conclude that they are equivalent in meaning. 

Here I try to outline how the open-question argument can be used to substantiate the non-cognitivist standpoint. It is not too convoluted of an argument. A chief upshot of the open-question argument is that there is a semantic nonfactualism about moral judgments that leave moral equivalences open. 

In fact, Moore's identity questions cannot be viewed as closed even to competent speakers as the questions are not equivalent (or not prima facie equivalent). Therefore, the moral expressions used in these questions, or the notion of equivalence itself when used in this context, do not predicate any property, and are equivalent in function to descriptive statements. The conclusion is that moral statements have a normative element that is distinct from descriptive statements.

Lastly, one can also appeal for non-cognitivsm by appealing to what we call *Hume's Law*. Also known as the is-ought problem, it is the premise that one cannot directly use a priori means to derive a prescriptive statement from a descriptive statement without introducing additional moral premises. Thus, non-moral descriptive statements cannot produce a moral conclusion. Non-cognitivists use this by claiming that moral judgments express the proposal of some function; descriptive statements do not possess this quality. Descriptive statements must ipso facto have some implicit imperatival component in order to entail the moral conclusion. 

There are many varieties of non-cognitivism. The prescriptivist viewpoint claims that moral judgments are commands; a statement like "stealing is wrong" is equivalent to "do not steal". Since moral judgments are imperatives, there can be no such thing as moral error. The quasi-realist school of thought emphasises why we are entitled to act as if moral judgments are truth-apt when they are not truth-apt. Personally I think that quasi-realism does not attack the problem of truth-aptness but rather act as a motivational theory for how we project our attitudes and values onto the world as if they were real properties; under the pretense that ethical statements are not truth-apt our projections are effectuated in a way that makes them truth-apt. My disapproval of the quasi-realist perspective largely follows the Frege-Geach problem, which is also used as a counterargument to emotivism.

Emotivism is perhaps not the most tenable variant of non-cognitivism, but certainly opens itself up to much discourse.

### Emotivism

A. J. Ayer, in his *The Emotive Theory of Ethics*, uses this following example to elucidate the emotivist theory. If I said "Stealing money is wrong", the upshots of my utterance is equivalent to saying "Stealing money!!!" with the exclamation marks suggesting immense disapproval. Value judgments like "stealing money is bad" do not truly exist independently of our emotions.

Ayer's argument roughly proceeds as follows. The first few steps proceeds similarly to the non-cognitivist argument, but implements what Ayer would call the *verification principle*.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) He first assumes the verification principle as a baseline criteria for determining whether a statement can be factually meaningful. Ayer claims that a synthetic proposition is truth-apt only if it is empirically verifiable, meaning that there exist observations that we can employ to deduce said propositions as true or false.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Ethical propositions cannot be reduced to statements of empirical fact. We cannot reduce ethical terms to a pure utilitarian analysis because some actions that are generally approved of can be viewed as immoral. 

Similarly, we cannot use Bentham's utilitarian calculus to maximise happiness and minimise pain as it is sometimes wrong to perform the action that elicits the greatest happiness. In fact - such a proposition may not be utilitarian in nature: see the distinction between direct and indirect utilitarianism. Therefore, it isn't self-contradictory to say that some pleasant things are not good; thus it cannot be said that the sentence "x is good" is equivalent to "x is pleasant".

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Ethical statements are synthetic, not analytic. Therefore, as they are not tautological truths, ethical statements are not meaningful and are not truth-apt. 

These three steps entail the non-cognitivist conclusion. But why emotivism? 

Ayer writes that one cannot test the validity of ethical concepts as they are "pseudo-concepts"; only moral sentiments, and nothing true/false, is said here. Consider the statement "you stole money!": this is merely an expression of moral disapproval that, to the prescriptivists, doubles as a command not to steal (vis-a-vis the statement "stealing money is wrong"). 

This leads to the argument for emotivism:

4) By expressing the moral sentiment, one merely expresses one's individual attitudes, or one's approval towards a certain matter. Note the difference between an assertion of disapproval and an expression of one. Assertions like "Stealing money is wrong" and expressions like "I disapprove of stealing money" are non-equivalent: the former, a non-propositional statement, merely expresses disapproval.

Ethical statements not only express feelings but also arouse them. Any statement of the type "you should X" tacitly contains a command to perform X. Thus, the upshots of the emotivist perspective are twofold - the first upshot pertains to the feelings that they generally intend to elicit; the second pertains to the responses that they provoke. 

### Discussing the Emotivist perspective

A common-sensical way to object to the emotivist argument is to first determine whether the verification principle is tenable, for the entire argument is constructed upon said principle. Before deconstructing the verification principle, it is notable that the conclusion of emotivism from non-cognitivism is not a non-negotiable one.

The most eminent objection is the identification of non-cognitivism with "boo-hurrahism". When I make a moral claim like "theft is wrong", I merely make a claim that I believe, under the purview of moral judgments that I hold, to represent my perception of the state of the world. Who says that I am booing an action?

### Variants of the verification principle

The *Sanxingdui （三星堆）*, a Chinese archaeological site excavated from the 1980s onwards (the most recent significant discovery was in 2021), contained artefacts dated from circa. 1700 to 1150 B.C. If someone who procured knowledge about the Sanxingdui through historical texts before the excavations were to make statements about it, Ayer's theory would deem those statements meaningness as said statements could not be empirically verified. 

One counterargument is to claim *weak verification*, where a statement is meaningful if there is some conceivable empirical observation that substantiates the statement albeit not being conclusively verified by a posteriori means. Here, we take a statement $S$ to be conclusively verifiable if there exists a set of statements that produce $S$. 

Let's first outline the problems with strong verification. Any universal, sweeping quantification of the form "all X satisfies property P" cannot be established with true certainty by any finite set of observations. Similarly, conclusively falsifiable statements of the form "there exists an X with property P" cannot be established by a finite set of observations as these statements are merely a negation of the former. 

These are synthetic statements that seem truth-apt but not empirically verifiable - e.g. "there was a man living in the ancient civilisation that gave rise to the Sanxingdui archaeological site who died on Jan 1st, 1400 B.C.".

The most damning example of this objection is that the verification principle is a self-defeating argument. The statement is synthetic but claims that "all truth-apt synthetic propositions are empirically verifiable", suggesting that it is a universal quantification and cannot be established by any finite set of empirical observations. So is the verification principle not truth-apt?

### Cultural relativism vs emotivism

I would like to conclude by noting some oft-conflated similarities between cultural relativism<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-4" className="hover:underline">1</a></sup> and emotivism. At first glance, both perspectives do agree that a moral statement like "theft is wrong" has no definitive answer; the cultural relativist may belief that theft is wrong in some scenarios, and not wrong in others. 

The difference is that if we restrict ourselves to certain societal scenarios or purviews, cultural relativists do tend to believe in a form of objective moral truth albeit said moral truth not being absolute qua moral realists. The statement "theft is wrong" holds true only within the boundaries of certain cultural settings (but not in others). While cultural relativists stand by the non-absolute nature of this moral judgment, it is an attempted description of a relativistic truth. Emotivists, evidently, do not believe this.
