Before I begin, I would like to preface by claiming that this is not a complete encapsulation of the upshots and objections pertaining to moral emotivism. These are just some of my thoughts on the matter.

### Introduction

The non-cognitivist standpoint regarding moral principles is one that claims that moral statements are not truth-apt (meaning we can assign truthfulness or falsity to moral statements), and thus statements about right and wrong are inherently meaningless. This is because moral statements are not analytic, meaning that they are not true by definition or are axiomatically true, or are substantiated by empirical verification. In contrast, cognitivists believe that moral statements are truth-apt, meaning that statements with moral predicates have the same effect of expressing belief as statements with descriptive predicates.

Emotivism is a variety of non-cognitivism. Not only are moral statements not truth-apt, but they function primarily to express emotions. If I say "theft is wrong", I am simply voicing my emotional disapproval for theft as someone who says "theft is right" voices their emotional approval for it. The statement itself cannot demonstrate that theft is wrong. **Ethical statements do not outline truths, but are expressions of emotion.**

Furthermore, I believe that most moral terms have the dual objective of endowing itself with its descriptive predicate and achieving the emotivist objective. For example, the statement "he is ruthless" predicates itself with the definition of being ruthless. In fact, I can't think of a counterexample where a moral predicate does not intrinsically contain a descriptive predicate.

Before we continue, let's distinguish between types of statements. Consider these three statements.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A) Thieves are people who steal.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B) You are a thief.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C) You acted immorally by virtue of you being a thief.

A) is an analytic statement, meaning that it is declarative and is true by definition. B) is a synthetic statement, meaning that it is a truth-apt statement as its truthfulness is dependent on the state of the world and is not intrinsically defined. These assertions can be confirmed or refuted by empirical observations. C) is a moral-judgment statement, meaning that C) is synonymous with the statement "Boo to theft!"

Non-cognitivists believe that only the first two statements are truth-apt, while cognitivists believe that all three statements are truth-apt. 

### Cognitivsm and non-naturalism

Before we defend the emotivist argument I'd like to spend some time exploring some  defences and upshots of a cognitivst standpoint. More specifically, I would like to explore the cognitivist non-naturalist standpoint, which claims that moral statements are truth-apt statements, and are descriptive and meaningful. However, these descriptions are distinct from natural properties and cannot be reduced to any natural properties. The former is the cognitivist standpoint, while the latter is the non-naturalist standpoint. Here I first discuss non-naturalism before cognitivism.

Let's first consider the following line of reasoning (a modus tollens). Here, properties like being pleasurable or being happy are natural properties, while properties like being good or being right are moral properties.  



  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P1: By definition, $x$ being good is equivalent to $x$ being pleasant. Therefore, the question "is pleasure good?" is equal to the tautological statement "is pleasure pleasure?". In the same vein, the question "is pleasure good" is a closed question.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P2: The question "is pleasure good?" or the statement "pleasure is good" is something substantive and not meaningless; it is debatable.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C: There is no analytic link between $x$ being good and $x$ being pleasant. Once it is estsablished that $x$ is pleasant, the question of whether $x$ is good is an open question.



By this chain of reasoning, the claim that $x$ is good is inherently a meaningless claim. Any connection between a natural property and a moral property leads to a tautology. 

This line of reasoning, known as Moore's *open-question argument*, can be applied to other value judgments such as propriety and duty. For example, consider Bentham's utility calculus where one must choose the action that maximises pleasure and minimises pain. The question "$x$ adheres to Bentham's utility calculus, but is $x$ right?" is an open question. Mill's utilitarianism, connecting the state of happiness (which exists naturally) and the state of being good (a moral property), commits what Moore calls the *naturalistic fallacy.*

I'll consider some objections to the non-naturalist perspective. 

The first objection is rather simple. Can a natural property P be identical to good? The non-naturalist standpoint claims that because this is an open question, no natural property P can be identical to good. This argument begs the question against the naturalism perspective (by directly assuming that the naturalistic position is fallacious) as it assumes that "pleasure is good" is not tautological. 

But let's assume that we procured a non-tautological statement like "pleasure is good". "Good" may fall into the category of dubious moral statements which content is not explicitly elucidated, but is equivalent to a natural concept wherein said equivalence is not obvious and is not well-elucidated to us. Perhaps a better way to put this is that "good" may not be non-natural; it is just that we have yet to found the basis to demonstrate its naturality. 

There is much discourse on this topic specifically revolving around the "paradox of analysis", which we won't delve much into here. The core upshot is that it is possible for two different expressions to refer to the same thing, even if the definition seems to be an open question. Here it is implied that an adequate anlaysis is a transparent one, when in reality the analysans may not be equivalent in meaning to the analysandum. Therefore, if said property P was a property of good, the ambiguity of the identity relation may mean that we still consider the question of whether P is identical to good an open one. 

There are some issues with these objections which I will briefly go through. Although the open-question argument seems to be a question-begging argument, the begged questions are not conceptually open "to competent users of moral terms". For a competent analyst, the question "is pleasure good" is evidently more open than the question "is NaCl table salt?" A common way of laying out this argument is by appealing to the fact that opponents of non-naturalism can see that some questions are conceptually open; thus non-naturalism is not a direct consequence of the argument's premise. However this is a much weaker version of the original open-question argument.

One counter-argument that naturalists use is that although Moore's questions may seem open, moral properties may be equivalent to naturalistic properties in a non-tautological sense through empirical discovery. But the world is often not black-and-white, and even though we cannot conclude that two terms P and Q may not be distinct, we cannot immediately conclude that they are equivalent in meaning. 

Here I try to outline how the open-question argument can be used to substantiate the non-cognitivist standpoint. It is not too convoluted of an argument. A chief upshot of the open-question argument is that there is a semantic nonfactualism about moral judgments that leave moral equivalences open. In fact, Moore's identity questions cannot be viewed as closed even to competent speakers as the questions are not equivalent (or not prima facie equivalent). Therefore, the moral expressions used in these questions, or the notion of equivalence itself when used in this context,
