### On contrarianism

In 399 BC, Socrates was charged with *asebeia*, or irreverence, against the Panthenon of Athens, instead bringing strange divinities of his own, and for bringing moral corruption to the Athenian youth. Socrates was accused of corrupting the youth by instructing them to despise established laws by appealing to the folly of the ballot box, or in other words, for teaching the youth to question authority. The main line of argument was that to question and subsequently embarrass people of power would allow the populace to lose respect for their elders and those in power, hence corrupting them.

It is often challenging to defend a politically contrarian viewpoint. The reasons for this are several:

<div>

<ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">

  <li> Contrarians are often classified as disagreeing for disagreements' sake, often espousing argumentative positions that are unpleasant. </li>
  <li> It is commonplace for a contrarian to uphold universal values that contravenes conventional wisdom. Many contrarian values are often undefensible from conventinonal wisdom. </li>
  <li> We all strive to defend our existing values against information which challenges them. Political contrarianism ignites our defensive faculties as said information conflicts with our original beliefs. </li>

  <li> Contrarianism seems to have a bad rep as it seems to attract the worst out of people - the most amoral, disruptive, underhand etc. Even if contrarian views are amoral, many of these views can be substantiated relatively easily insofar as that it is not as hard as substantiating morally apt views. </li>
</ol>

Evidently there are many upshots to being a contrarian. Rigid definitions on morality and righteousness blind us to alternative points of view. It is by virtue of these clear-cut definitions that many theories and views are segregated into binaries; if one is on one side of the spectrum, the opposite side's viewpoint immediately becomes untenable. In fact, conventional wisdom upholds that one is forbidden from understanding the opposition and challenging the norms of the opposite position. 

A vice of modernity is that we live in a world that silences healthy, constructive dissent by living in a perpetual state of ideological war. To concede or admit some merits of the opposition is viewed as attacking one's own tribe. It is often that the leaver of the tribe is often subject to vitriolic abuse and attacks, and by this, contrarianism in the positive, constructive sense is often conflated with contrarianism in the bitter, abrasive sense. 

Many ad hominem arguments are used against contrarians rather than legitimate arguments against the points raised by the contrarian.

### On Mahbubani

Geopolitics is a cruel, emotionally charged endeavour. This is not new. It is motivated by viciousness and is accentuated by personal politics. Kishore Mahbubani knows this and stands his ground in spite of this. This, I hold, is a mark of great bravery. 

Bit of background - at time of writing, he is the Dean of the LKY School of Public Policy in Singapore, and he has served as President of the UN Security Council from 2001-2002. He has written and spoken on many contemporary issues in Asia, including discourse regarding the role of Hong Kong as holding a competitive edge as it is differentiated from mainland China. Yet the most prominent and extensive of his discourses lie in its defense of Asian values, the ideological decline of the West, and the eminent divide between what he denotes the West and the Rest. 

These are three of his arguments.

<ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">

  <li>The United States is losing ground to China not because China's bellicosity towards the US, but rather because of internal failure and strategic incoherence. It is for this reason that there has been much stagnation in economic development in the US.</li>
  <li>With the rise of the "Rest", the world is now returning to a global balance of power. Therefore, Asia's pre-eminence is not a matter of "if", but rather a matter of "when".</li>
  <li>Global institutions such as the UN Security Council must be better reformed to better represent the rapid changes in power over the past 3 decades.</li>

</ol>

<p> </p>

Here I will focus on the last one. These are just some of my brief musings.

### Reform vis-a-vis global governance

Mahbubani claims that there is a deep-seated, long-standing Western strategy to keep the United Nations weak and solely indicative of retaining core Western values. This system of global governance is weak as it only represents an eighth of the global population - a population pockmarked by diminishing economic and military power. 

In a sweeping divide between the "West" and the "Rest", Mahbubani claims that nations such as China has undergone dramatic economic change; the EU's economy was once ten times China's size in 1980 but are now of roughly the same size; China's economy will be twice the size of the EU's in 2050.  

Therefore the sensible move would be to adopt international organisations to deal with the new world order - structural changes to said order. He argues that Europe's resistance to this change in the global order leads to a global governance structure that facilitates economic stagnation and even deterioration. 

A common way to illustrate this disparity in power is by considering the IMF. Voting power and decision-making in the IMF is determined by member countries' relative economic position. Although the share of global GDP for China and the EU are the same, Europe's share of voting power is four times that of China. 

This disproportionate influence is hard to counter. A seemingly tenable counter-argument points to the more judicious use of said GDP by major economic powers. IMF quotas not only include GDP in their evaluation, but also account for factors such as international reserves and the openness of a country. Although the structure of global economic power is changing numbers-wise, the historical contributions and commitments made by these European nations (especially those instrumental in the IMF's founding and development) are not to be ignored. The current alignment of power with existing geopolitical alliances is also a great testament to historical collaborative relations. However this argument is not tenable as we are entering a world order not of *multipolarity* but of *multiplexity* - a vision of global order that eschews the proliferation of a few diverse and eminent state actors, and heralds a multi-layered system of governance that reflects the fragmented yet interconnected nature of the world.

Now consider the UN Security Council, comprised of the P5 (permanent member states) and 10 elected members. Perhaps it is more accurately said that these 10 elected members are observers of the UNSC. But these five powers were repesentative of a time long gone. 

In 1993, the UN General Assembly established an *Open-ended Working Group (OEWG)* to consider Security Council reform to enable equitable representation regarding its modus operandi. Evidently there has been little change. The United Nations, and every political or economic system by and large has created a framework where change is embraced at first glance; but when change is to be effectuated, the global West manufactures a system to inhibit these changes.

In an article published July 7th, 2025, chief Financial Times economics commentator Martin Wolf wrote that the UK suffers from three malaises - failing politics, a failing state, and a failing economy. In it, he explains that the rate of increase in real household disposable income per capita is decreasing. (so $Y''(t)<0$ and $Y'(t)>0$ for the economists here) UK's rise in productivity over the past two decades was also among the slowest of the Western countries. Evidently a country that serves as a permanent member on the UNSC should not have such malaises, and thus the UK should give up its permanent membership. Mahbubani argues that this is because "Great" Britain is no longer "Great" and has not used its UN veto power for the last few decades.

A few counterarguments arise. The most prominent counterargument pertains to the fact that influence on the Security Council goes beyond the use of veto power; elements such as influence in diplomatic negotiations and general diplomatic power have to be considered. Additionally it wouldn't be difficult to assert that India's inclusion in the UNSC would be widely welcomed by a non-negligible proportion of the world's countries. These counterarguments are very weak. It is unrealistic for any country to give up its veto; at the current juncture, reform would most likely be done through an expansion of the list of permanent members.
