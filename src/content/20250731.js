### On contrarianism

In 399 BC, Socrates was charged with *asebeia*, or irreverence, against the Panthenon of Athens, instead bringing strange divinities of his own, and for bringing moral corruption to the Athenian youth. Socrates was accused of corrupting the youth by instructing them to despise established laws by appealing to the folly of the ballot box, or in other words, for teaching the youth to question authority. The main line of argument was that to question and subsequently embarrass people of power would allow the populace to lose respect for their elders and those in power, hence corrupting them.

It is often challenging to defend a politically contrarian viewpoint. The reasons for this are several:

<div>

<ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">

  <li> Contrarians are often classified as disagreeing for disagreements' sake, often espousing argumentative positions that are unpleasant. </li>
  <li> It is commonplace for a contrarian to uphold universal values that contravenes conventional wisdom. Many contrarian values are often undefensible from conventinonal wisdom. </li>
  <li> We all strive to defend our existing values against information which challenges them. Political contrarianism ignites our defensive faculties as said information conflicts with our original beliefs. </li>

  <li> Contrarianism seems to have a bad rep as it seems to attract the worst out of people - the most amoral, disruptive, underhand etc. Even if contrarian views are amoral, many of these views can be substantiated relatively easily insofar as that it is not as hard as substantiating morally apt views. </li>
</ol>

Evidently there are many upshots to being a contrarian. Rigid definitions on morality and righteousness blind us to alternative points of view. It is by virtue of these clear-cut definitions that many theories and views are segregated into binaries; if one is on one side of the spectrum, the opposite side's viewpoint immediately becomes untenable. In fact, conventional wisdom upholds that one is forbidden from understanding the opposition and challenging the norms of the opposite position. 

A vice of modernity is that we live in a world that silences healthy, constructive dissent by living in a perpetual state of ideological war. To concede or admit some merits of the opposition is viewed as attacking one's own tribe. It is often that the leaver of the tribe is often subject to vitriolic abuse and attacks, and by this, contrarianism in the positive, constructive sense is often conflated with contrarianism in the bitter, abrasive sense. 

Many ad hominem arguments are used against contrarians rather than legitimate arguments against the points raised by the contrarian.

### On Mahbubani

Geopolitics is a cruel, emotionally charged endeavour. This is not new. It is motivated by viciousness and is accentuated by personal politics. Kishore Mahbubani knows this and stands his ground in spite of this. This, I hold, is a mark of great bravery. 

Bit of background - at time of writing, he is the Dean of the LKY School of Public Policy in Singapore, and he has served as President of the UN Security Council from 2001-2002. He has written and spoken on many contemporary issues in Asia, including discourse regarding the role of Hong Kong as holding a competitive edge as it is differentiated from mainland China. Yet the most prominent and extensive of his discourses lie in its defense of Asian values, the ideological decline of the West, and the eminent divide between what he denotes the West and the Rest. 

I will focus on three of his arguments:

<ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
  <li>The United States is losing ground to China not because China's bellicosity towards the US, but rather because of internal failure and strategic incoherence. It is for this reason that there has been much stagnation in economic development in the US.</li>
  <li>With the rise of the "Rest", the world is now returning to a global balance of power. Therefore, Asia's pre-eminence is not a matter of "if", but rather a matter of "when".</li>
  <li>Global institutions such as the UN Security Council must be better reformed to better represent the rapid changes in power over the past 3 decades.</li>
</ol>

### United States losing ground to China

### Economic success in Asia and future developments

### Reform vis-a-vis global governance
