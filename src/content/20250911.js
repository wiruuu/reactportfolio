### Premise

This is perhaps one of the most timely articles ever written for this blog. At time of writing, it has been less than half a day since right-wing political activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated in Orem, Utah at Utah Valley University. This text does not intend to discuss the tenability of his ideals (although some of my other posts have inadvertently touched on his ideals). It merely serves to explore if it is morally apt to celebrate and mock one's death.
