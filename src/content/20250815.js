### Premise

The battle to provide rights to same-sex married couples is a contentious one, with both sides simultaneously believing that too much / too little is being done to uphold the rights of same-sex couples. 

In Hong Kong, a contentious bill regarding same-sex couple rights was rejected; said bill merely granted only basic recognitions to same-sex couples, e.g. in bereavement arrangements and necessary medical decisions. Yet many of the arguments against same-sex marriage presented in this case are untenable or are not the strongest contenders against same-sex marriage. I present better arguments that said legislators may have used, as well as the objections to these arguments.

I categorise all arguments against gay marriage as *instrumental*, *intrinsic*, or *religious* arguments. Here I ignore the "foreign conspiracy" argument - where LGBTQ+ rights are controlled by foreign forces to pose a threat to the very fabric of a nation's civilisation. I also ignore nonsensical arguments like the argument that homosexuals cause natural disasters or how fatal tragedies are executions of divine retribution for the intrinsic vice that is homosexuality.

### Instrumental arguments

These are arguments that relate to what gay marriage entails for civilised society.

<p className="text-xl font-medium"> Gay couples are not just happy having marriage. They want to spread their ideology and corrupt your children. In short, they exist to propagate a malicious agenda.</p>

This is an argument used by the likes of right-wing activists which holds some tenability at first. Some LGBTQ+ activists want more than just traditional discrimination protection. Some want the rapid and forceful changing of social norms -- a great, quick, and decisive *liberation*. When done in forceful ways and to extensively dismantle the thoughts of systems and institutions to fit one's mode of thinking, this could be viewed as ideological inculcation. 

The Pride movement was founded on the basis of mutual respect and the recognition that some people live lives different from the extensive majority - a luck-egalitarian argument that societal inequalities such as those commmited against homosexuals are only acceptable if they result from voluntary, responsible choices and not from "bad luck". The minority of institutions who want *reparative* or compensative justice against decades of unequal rights aim to systematically cajole people into believing that more than equality is required. They need presence; they need to be heralded; they need to be lauded in a sense that places them in a socially superior position than non-LGBTQ+ individuals, ceteris paribus. 

In short, this is the "special rights" argument, or the argument that even though the LGBTQ+ movement does not currently represent the minority of activists arguing for special rights, excessive or prolonged exposure to this community would galvanise a non-negligible proportion of activists to argue for special rights.

This argument is simple to treat. In many widely defended political positions there are individuals who declare their political standpoint as being supreme and right, and thus should be given disproportionate resources to facilitate this. 

<p className="text-xl font-medium"> Gay marriage, as as a part of the LGBTQ+ agenda's indoctrination, leads to an ideology of sexual deviance and impropriety.</p>

In other words, if we accept gay marriage, then we tacitly accept the normalisation of unbridled licentiousness and sexual deviance. A variant of this argument argues that if we allow gay marriage, then we will have to allow [*insert morally improper policy*], which would be detrimental to society. Examples of improper policies include the legalisation of polygamy, the abolition of the age of consent, and incest.

<p className="text-xl font-medium">Many gay rights activists or groups are too forceful with their fight for LGBTQ+ exposure, extensively inserting discourse on gender theory in numerous unrelated contexts and vehemently shunning those who disagree with this large-scale propagation of discourse. Discourse on sexuality and gender should not permeate unrelated contexts.</p>

There is the follow-up thesis that even though most activists are not this forceful, prolonged dialogue on gay marriage and the legality of gay marriage will further goad this permeation. 

The typical argument against excessive forcefulness is by appealing to Srinivasan's aptness argument. 

Out of the instrumental arguments (and arguments in general), I believe this is the most tenable.



### Intrinsic arguments

These are arguments linked to gay marriage, or homosexuality in general, being an inherent wrong. Note that religious arguments do fall under this category - though the distinction is that religious arguments appeals to supernatural morality, where these arguments appeal to a priori or a posteriori claims.

<p className="text-xl font-medium">The acceptance and legality of gay marriage will harm the social moral order and traditional family values.</p>

<p className="text-xl font-medium">Marriage, by definition, should exist as a legal union which benefits society by increasing the population and to raise the youth.</p>

A similar argument goes like this: "Marriage is, tautologically, the union of one man and one woman. Thus the civil rights that gay activists are fighting for is not marriage", or that "gay marriage is like trying to call a dog a cat".

<p className="text-xl font-medium">Procreation is essential for survival and is an objective of marriage. Gay couples cannot procreate as a couple, so gay couples should not be allowed to marry.</p>

### Religious arguments

These are arguments that appeal to religious texts.
