### Premise

The battle to provide rights to same-sex married couples is a contentious one, with both sides simultaneously believing that too much / too little is being done to uphold the rights of same-sex couples. 

In Hong Kong, a contentious bill regarding same-sex couple rights was rejected; said bill merely granted only basic recognitions to same-sex couples, e.g. in bereavement arrangements and necessary medical decisions. Yet many of the arguments against same-sex marriage presented in this case are untenable or are not the strongest contenders against same-sex marriage. I quickfire through better arguments that said legislators may have used, as well as the objections to these arguments.

I categorise all arguments against gay marriage as *instrumental*, *intrinsic*, or *religious* arguments. Here I ignore the "foreign conspiracy" argument - where LGBTQ+ rights are controlled by foreign forces to pose a threat to the very fabric of a nation's civilisation. I also ignore nonsensical arguments like the argument that homosexuals cause natural disasters or how fatal tragedies are executions of divine retribution for the intrinsic vice that is homosexuality.

I do not discuss, in particular, religious arguments here as they typically appeal to scripture which is rather indefensible in nature. Or rather it should be said that it is rather futile to counter-argue any religious position. 

### Instrumental arguments

These are arguments that relate to what gay marriage entails for civilised society.

<p className="text-xl font-medium"> Gay couples are not just happy having marriage. They want to spread their ideology and corrupt your children. In short, they exist to propagate a malicious agenda.</p>

This is an argument used by the likes of right-wing activists which holds some tenability at first. Some LGBTQ+ activists want more than just traditional discrimination protection. Some want the rapid and forceful changing of social norms -- a great, quick, and decisive *liberation*. When done in forceful ways and to extensively dismantle the thoughts of systems and institutions to fit one's mode of thinking, this could be viewed as ideological inculcation. 

The Pride movement was founded on the basis of mutual respect and the recognition that some people live lives different from the extensive majority - a luck-egalitarian argument that societal inequalities such as those commmited against homosexuals are only acceptable if they result from voluntary, responsible choices and not from "bad luck". The minority of institutions who want *reparative* or compensative justice against decades of unequal rights aim to systematically cajole people into believing that more than equality is required. They need presence; they need to be heralded; they need to be lauded in a sense that places them in a socially superior position than non-LGBTQ+ individuals, ceteris paribus. 

In short, this is the "special rights" argument, or the argument that even though the LGBTQ+ movement does not currently represent the minority of activists arguing for special rights, excessive or prolonged exposure to this community would galvanise a non-negligible proportion of activists to argue for special rights. 

This argument is simple to treat. First, one would have to argue what "special rights" means. Is allowing gay marriage an example of special rights? What about DEI? Who is to say?

In many widely defended political positions there are individuals who declare their political standpoint as being supreme and right, and thus should be given disproportionate resources to facilitate this. The burden of proof is on the opposition to show that this "loud minority" of activists is any different from the loud minorities of any other political position, and to demonstrate why we should not apply this argument with other political positions with loud and unreasonable minorities. A probable solution is for nations to apply restrictions on the extent and nature of LGBTQ+ rights advocacy for extreme cases, or for major advocacy groups to clearly state the expectations and provisions vis-a-vis LGBTQ+ rights that they aim to fight for.

Another argument under this vein is that societies should encourage what is best for children, which is a mother and a father who are the parents of that child, raising that child in a stable, married relationship. Though it is not hard to counterargue that the quality of parent-child relationships, parental competence and security, and the family's economic position are greater indicators of well-being.

<p className="text-xl font-medium"> Gay marriage, as as a part of the LGBTQ+ agenda's indoctrination, leads to an ideology of sexual deviance and impropriety, as well as diminish the expectations of parental commitment.</p>

In other words, if we accept gay marriage, then we tacitly accept the normalisation of unbridled licentiousness and sexual deviance. A variant of this argument argues that if we allow gay marriage, then we will have to allow [*insert morally improper policy*], which would be detrimental to society. Examples of improper policies include the legalisation of polygamy, the abolition of the age of consent, and incest.

This is a popular slippery slope argument that assumes gay marriage activists won't stop at gay marriage and will lead to some sort of forceful ideological inculcation. Before gay marriage was the decriminalisation of homosexuality and the recognition of civil unions which did not provide the same spectrum of rights as heterosexual couples. We could argue similarly that women's suffrage would lead to women wanting to control who gets to vote, and subsequently set ludicrous lower bounds on the proportion of women in political power and limit the extent to which men can run for political office and even vote.

During the Lavender Scare of the 20th century, the United States government used a similar series of hypotheticals to instill moral panic regarding homosexual people and to force them out of government service. But what if these hypotheticals were real? There has been an increasing trend in teaching young and adolescent children how LGBTQ+ works; DEI and moral training in many white-collar professions have sought to instruct workers on pronoun usage. If aimed at an egalitarian perspective I see no reason as to why one should shun it - though to shun gay mariage because of these potential upshots woul be to shun women's suffrage as some argue that DEI programmes provide an unfair advantage to women.

To argue against the slippery slope fallacy, one should observe that this fallacy assumes that society is unwilling or unable to prevent a certain outcome. It assumes that not only will the consequences occur, but these consequences will be cornerstones of society instead of mere exceptions. To counter-argue that the legalisation of gay marriage leads to the legalisation of bestiality, one can comment that non-human animals cannot legally consent to sexual relations, and thus the slippery slope fails. 

The legalisation of incest as a consequence of legalising gay marriage is slightly more tricky to defend. One can tackle this by considering that the legalisation of gay marriage is the recognition that one should not discriminate for reasons owing to sexual orientation, and that incestuous relationships spring out of perversions in one's lifestyle, similar to those who have pedophilic perversions. There is no civil rights issue concerning incest as there is homosexuality; there is no "incestuous sexual orientation". Both homosexual marriages and incestuous marriages broaden the institution of marriage, but in no social dimension does the latter provide a benefit in freedoms. There is also an instrumental argument. In society, incest is typically synonymous with abuse, rape, and sexual exploitation. By keeping incest illegal we can prosecute those who perform these sexual exploitations more easily.  

<p className="text-xl font-medium">If same-sex marriage becomes the norm, we will have much less traditional marriages.</p>

This argument is usually laced with the subtext that marriage becomes meaningless if two arbitrary people could get married for no reason. There is a decline in the number of marriages, a delay in people getting married, and more children being born out of wedlock, which are all detrimental to children.

A few arguments. The most crucial is a differential argument, where the burden of proof lies on the opposition to demonstrate the causative relationship between this delay and the increased prevalence of gay marriage. Many studies have shown that urbanisation and economic growth have caused child-rearing costs to take up larger percentages of disposable incomes, even in nations where same-sex marriages are not prevalent. Even in nations where consumers have a great propensity to save, the general rise in living costs relative to income, debt burdens, and the more ambitious pursuance of higher education has induced greater financial instability. As it is more difficult to attain financial independence, career and personal aspirations, as well as the liberation of mind from rigid societal institutions have become prevalent. It is not easy to argue that disallowing gay marriage would shift these other “vices” of modern-day society. 

Then the second argument is that a delay in marriages is detrimental to children. A delay in childbirth would increase certain health risks, but this argument hinges on the causative one above. A more pertinent argument is the decline in marriages and thus the decline in childbirth. Though I would argue that homosexuals would otherwise stay unmarried, or if forced by the grips of society to procreate contra their will, would create an environment for their children far more detrimental than the environment elicited by those who purport that a child’s moral upbringing is diminished by the lack of the simultaneous presence of the mother and father. Unless one would argue that the rise in homosexuality’s prevalence would goad those who were otherwise heterosexual to not be, which I have addressed. To the previous argument one can counter-argue that conjuring a social climate that, on aggregate, encourages marriage justifies the loss of a few bad apples. This is a much weaker argument as it is evident that the sole driver of marriage is not society’s galvanisation, and that the allowance of gay marriages would completely inhibit this galvanisation.


<p className="text-xl font-medium">Many gay rights activists or groups are too forceful with their fight for LGBTQ+ exposure, extensively inserting discourse on gender theory in numerous unrelated contexts and vehemently shunning those who disagree with this large-scale propagation of discourse. Discourse on sexuality and gender should not permeate unrelated contexts.</p>

Out of the instrumental arguments (and arguments in general), I believe this is the most tenable.

Examples of "unrelated contexts" include in education, especially early education. How much emphasis, if any, should a teacher put on gay marriage? My personal preference is that early-education educators should place no more emphasis on LGBTQ+ marriages than they do heterosexual marriages. I also prefer for discourse, especially in early education, to touch on factual, impartial topics pertaining to the LGBTQ+ rather than to imbue students with a certain mindset as anti-homosexual activists would also do. 

There is the follow-up thesis that even though most activists are not this forceful, prolonged dialogue on gay marriage and the legality of gay marriage will further goad this permeation. See my argument on special rights.

The typical argument against excessive forcefulness is by appealing to Srinivasan's aptness argument. 

### Intrinsic arguments

These are arguments linked to gay marriage, or homosexuality in general, being an inherent wrong. Note that religious arguments do fall under this category - though the distinction is that religious arguments appeals to supernatural morality, where these arguments appeal to a priori or a posteriori claims. 

Some of these arguments are instrumental in nature. The distinction is that intrinsic arguments concern ramifications towards the person.

<p className="text-xl font-medium">The acceptance and legality of gay marriage will harm the social moral order and traditional family values.</p>

n.b. This argument appears to be an instrumental argument, but I classify it as an intrinsic argument as the upshots pertain to the intrinsic ethics of same-sex marriage.

This argument appeals to the "normalness" of heterosexual marriages. When one counter argues that it would not seem morally impermissible for gay couples living together to be married, the common objection is that same-sex marriage deconstructs the privilege of marriage, and has detrimental consequences to society as society should prioritise the encouragement of what’s best for children.

Changes to familial abuse or neglect laws over time have shown, time and time again, that the notion of a "traditional" family is a highly mutable one, and is a notion that has less lexicographical priority than fundamental equality under the law. 

<p className="text-xl font-medium">Marriage, by definition, should exist as a legal union which benefits society by increasing the population and to raise the youth.</p>

A similar argument goes like this: "Marriage is, tautologically, the union of one man and one woman. Thus the civil rights that gay activists are fighting for is not marriage", or that "gay marriage is like trying to call a dog a cat".

What if I loosened the institution of marriage to include polygamous relationships as this would further increase the population and more people in the polygamous relationship could be dedicated to raise said children? The definition of the age of consent has changed drastically for many countries over the past century.

<p className="text-xl font-medium">Procreation is essential for survival and is an objective of marriage. Gay couples cannot procreate as a couple, so gay couples should not be allowed to marry.</p>

Some variants or corollaries of this argument, which relate to the intrinsic roles and objectives of marrriage include:

<div className="border-l-4 border-primary/70 pl-4">
<div className="text-md">

  1: Children have a biological yearning for their fathers / mothers. Gay couples cannot provide for children what heterosexual couples do. For example, little girls without fathers fail at interacting with men as they do not have a constant male figure.

  2: Marriages thrive when spouses take on roles faithful to their gender.
</div>
</div>


Under these two colloraries we immediately see how this argument fails - or rather is not within the purview of our study as to substantiate this would require arguments relating to the normative roles of marriage. This is not hard to argue - one can start by asking the question "should we bar couples that do not plan to procreate from marrying as their aid to the human race is no less than homosexual couples", or "should we bar married persons from divorce as their child would lack a constant male / female figure", or rather, "how big of a difference to a child's understanding of gender dynamics is caused by the lack of a male / female figure?"


<p className="text-xl font-medium">The burden of proof is on gay couples in proving why they should get married for the same reasons straight couples do - an argument that doesn't just pertain to wants, but pertains to how they benefit society. </p>

This argument seemingly provides justification for why there is a double standard, and why basic rights like marriage, which have been available to heterosexual couples for long, cannot be extended to homosexual couples as on aggregate, homosexual couples do not provide equal benefit to society as heterosexual couples. An argument from opportunity cost proves reasonable in this circumstance.
