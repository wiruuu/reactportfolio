          I'm an undergraduate sophomore studying economics in London with quantitative interests in econometrics and quant finance. I'm also an algo trader and quant developer specialising in ML and statistical arbitrage who likes building nice web apps. I write recreationally on many topics and have written 2 maths textbooks.

                I have two goals in life. The first is to act with virtue and excellence. The second is to service my local community.
              </p>
              <p>
                These two things are non-negotiables in the righteous life. Interestingly enough, they can be (trivially) achieved regardless of social status, income level, or external successes. Many people prioritise other material gains in a way that overshadows this moral code, or do not prioritise this moral code.

              <p>Didactic lecture over. Now a bit about myself:</p>
              <p>
                When I was around 15, I wanted to be a maths researcher. I loved reading up on pure mathematics, specialising in number theory and algebra. But then all that abstraction with homological algebra and automorphic forms and whatnot made me lose touch with the world. Although this was very fun, every day working with said maths felt like I was tinkering with a convoluted system of cogs, strings, and screws in a contemporary art exhibit — while I did get the bigger picture, not everyone comes to truly appreciate abstract art even if they've worked with it for a while.<sup id="fnref-1">

                  </a>
                </sup>
              </p>

              <p>Two years passed. I wrote a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mpnwIl-NnpAkyUE9c2ygCtVuKJVgZsJg/view?usp=drive_link" className="underline"> book </a> on adelic <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Class_field_theory" className="underline">class field theory</a> which somewhat diminished my love for pure maths as I was writing it.<sup id="fnref-1">

                    2
                  </a>
                </sup> Probably due to tedium or lack of motivation to continue afterwards.</p>

              <p> I proceeded to study economics at undergraduate level.</p>

              <p>Why economics? Firstly we must understand the reasons for why people would be averse towards economics degrees at large. Undergraduate economics has been largely adherent to neoclassical economics and rational economic behaviour. In intermediate micro and macro courses students are given problem sets of a purely mathematical nature by which students use mechanical tools to work through a series of mental gymnastics. Most curriculums do not teach about ecological crises, geopolitics and colonialism, nor teach how to rid these rigid pedagogies and develop independent modes of thought. This is not an economics-specific diagnosis nor do I believe an effective antidote will be available very soon. </p>

              <p>Economics, when correctly taught, is grounded in solving problems and challenging the status quo. I try to tie political philosophy and climate policy, among other disciplines, in with economics. I agree that economics should not solely comprise of exercises in algebra and calculus with no regard for the limitations and assumptions of the models discussed. However, I am a strong advocate of econometrics and quantitative economics as means of ensuring rigour.</p>

              <p>Some models are useful. In quantitative finance, Black-Scholes is never used as a pricing model in practice but is useful as a reference in comparing the price of options using an analytic formula with clear-cut assumptions and flaws.<sup id="fnref-1">
                  <a href="#fn-3" className="hover:underline text-body">
                    3
                  </a>
                </sup> It is also useful for traders as they navigate these flaws and adjust their risk exposures accordingly. “Better” option pricing models are, by and large, propelled by Black-Scholes. A similar analogy can be made for economics models.</p>

                <li> It’s what I enjoy studying. It keeps me connected and aware with the world around me. It compels me to be largely abreast of global events and to know the reasons and rationales behind them. While abstract, it is often not abstract for abstraction’s sake. </li>
                <li> Economics is a largely quantitative discipline. Most quant firms do not have a rule barring economics majors. If I know my stuff, why shouldn't I join the fun?

              <p>When I’m not working or studying, I’m usually performing, producing, arranging, or composing music, watching a movie, or writing this blog. I also hike, climb, and swim, and do about a million random side quests.</p>

                An interesting piece of abstract art is Robert Ryman's <a href="https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en/ressources/oeuvre/yJJQZOL" className="underline hover:text-primary"><i>Untitled Triptych</i></a>, housed in the Centre Pompidou in Paris. 
                It contains three panels of white placed side by side. Perhaps this piece of art serves as an inapt analogy as my analogy with art intended to expose the abstract complexities of maths. But this is nevertheless an intriguing piece of artwork to bring up when someone asks you "what is art?".

                Traders usually use Black-Scholes as a "reference point" by first computing implied volatility and using that to guide them on how to quote on different strike prices. Thinking in implied volatility terms is, in most cases, better than thinking in option premium terms as the nature of options are inherently priced into Black-Scholes. Some of my blog posts discuss Black-Scholes in greater detail.

                The development of human nature is not a stochastic process. However I do that human inclinations have somewhat of a Markov property as is characteristic of GBM (and increments are not independent like regular Brownian motion): that <InlineMath math="P(X_{n+1}=x_{n+1} \mid X_1=x_1, \dots, X_n=x_n) = P(X_{n+1}=x_{n+1} \mid X_n=x_n)" />. In layman's terms, this means that the future state of a stochastic processes depends solely on the current state and not the states that precede it. I used the word <i>somewhat</i> as I do believe that when human behaviour and decisions are concerned, <InlineMath math="X_{n+1}"/> should be somewhat dependent on <InlineMath math="X_1, \dots, X_{n-1}"/>. I used this analogy to explain how drastically people can change.
