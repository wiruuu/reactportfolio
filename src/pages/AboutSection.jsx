                I have two goals in life. The first is to do things for good.
                The second is to service my local community.
              </p>
              <p>
                These two things are non-negotiables in the righteous life.
                Interestingly enough, they can be (trivially) achieved
                regardless of social status, income level, or external
                successes. Many people prioritise other material gains in a way
                that overshadows this moral code, or do not prioritise this
                moral code.

              <p>Didactic lecture over. Now a bit about myself:</p>
              <p>
                When I was around 15, I wanted to be a maths researcher. I loved
                reading up on pure mathematics, specialising in number theory
                and algebra. But then all that abstraction with homological
                algebra and automorphic forms and whatnot made me lose touch
                with the world. Although this was very fun, very day working with said maths felt like I was tinkering with an
                entangled system of cogs, strings, and screws â€” while I did get
                the bigger picture, not everyone comes to truly appreciate
                abstract art.<sup id="fnref-1">

                An interesting piece of abstract art is Robert Ryman's <a href="https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en/ressources/oeuvre/yJJQZOL" className="underline hover:text-primary"><i>Untitled Triptych</i></a>, housed in the Centre Pompidou in Paris. 
                It contains three panels of white placed side by side. Perhaps this is an inapt analogy as the analogy with art intended to expose the abstract complexities 
                of maths.
